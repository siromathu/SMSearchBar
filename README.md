# SMSearchBar
custom search bar


`SMSearchBar` is a `UIView` subclass with `UITextField` for text entry.

Once added, `SMSearchBar` will be added over `UINavigationBar`. When text is entered it will response back to Parent view through Closure.

For example, a table view with list of foods can be updated with new list by filtering using searched text.
